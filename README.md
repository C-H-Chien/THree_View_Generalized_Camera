# Minimal Solutions to Generalized Three-View Relative Pose Problem

## Introduction
This repository hosts the source code of the paper: <br />
"Minimal Solutions to Generalized Three-View Relative Pose Problem" published in ICCV 2023 (oral presentation). [[Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Ding_Minimal_Solutions_to_Generalized_Three-View_Relative_Pose_Problem_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)][[Supp](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/supplemental/Ding_Minimal_Solutions_to_ICCV_2023_supplemental.pdf)] <br />
Two minimal cases for the generalized three-view relative pose problem were proposed: *(i)* the 4-point case and *(ii)* the 6-line case, which are both solved by [GPU-HC](https://github.com/C-H-Chien/Homotopy-Continuation-Tracker-on-GPU). It has shown to be more robust than the generalized two-view relative pose (which requires 6 points for a minimal case), and are efficient, *e.g.*, ~5.11 (ms) for the 6-line case and 4.77 for the 4-point case running on NVIDIA Titan V GPU. <br />
(Note that the timings reported here are a bit faster than what was reported in the paper because the performance of our GPU-HC solver has greatly improved.)

## Dependencies
(1) CMake 3.14 or higher <br />
(2) MAGMA 2.6.1 or higher (used for easy complex number computation on both CPU and GPU sides) <br />
(3) CUDA 11.X or higher <br />
(4) cuBlas <br />
(5) openBlas <br />
(6) YAML-CPP from [here](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) (used to parse data from the .yaml file)

## Code Usage Instructions
**Note!! The code is under a major update right now. Expect to complete by Jan. 4th., 2025** 

## Synthetic Data
Synthetic data used to feed the solver is generated by ``synthetic-data/generate_*.m``. Basically it generates system target parameters, ground-truth relative rotations and translations, _etc_. You will find the order of the system target parameters so that it makes transmission from synthetic data to real-world data easy. <br />
